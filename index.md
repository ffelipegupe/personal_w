# Welcome to my personal website!

You will get to know me, some of my projects and my interests.

## About me

My name is **Felipe Gutierrez**. Actually, it's **Fabio** Felipe Gutierrez, there's some kind of tradition running in my family: since my great grandfather every _male_ born person is called Fabio, so everyone is called by their middle name. As for July 27th, 2021, I'm 27 years old and I live in Bogota, Colombia. I've completed the Foundations Curriculum and currently on Year 2 Web Stack Specialization at Holberton School.

I'm motivated by learning topics that I don't have any kind of knowledge, I always like to learn new and different things! I'm naturally a very curios person and I enjoy to investigate and to read about everything, meaning, science, technology, physics, astronomy, planes, animals.
